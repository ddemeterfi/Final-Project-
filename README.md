# Final-Project-

This is my final project 
The Binary version is a the model without the cascade while the multiple trace file creates the multiple trace version of the 
model. The god help me file is the base vesrion of the model. 

When running the multiple trace version of the model make sure not to create a second trace until after the first set of 

trials is run. This is beause the residual signal will not be created until after the first set of trails is run. 

So, 1. create the intial trace

    2. Run the intail trials 
    
    3. create the second trace 
    
    4. Run the second set of trials 
    
    5. Create the third trace 
    
    6 Run the third set of trails 
    
    7. Combine the three data frames created into one 
    
    8. Plot using ggplot code at the bottom.
